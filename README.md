# Data-Analysis-Process

This project is from the Data Analysis Nano Degree from Udacity. The intent is to walk through the data analysis process on a medical patient show/no-show dataset, identifying the relationshp between various dependent variables to the dependent variable - whether a patient will show up or not.

It starts off at data wrangling, then to exploratory analysis and finally drawing conclusions from the findings.


This dataset is from Kaggle
